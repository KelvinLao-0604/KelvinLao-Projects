Challening platform game (Maplestory Jump Quest)
Goal: Feel the dopamine reward at the end of a challenge.
Sucessful: The player keeps playing and trying to reach the end.
Failure: The player quits and gives up reaching the end.
Core loop: Keep trying to platform and reach the end. Will likely end up with a lot of resets but will be very rewarding once you reach the end.

Postmortem
-Orginally set out to create a challening platformer
- Goals stayed the same and I accomplished it all
- The general concepts all came out pretty well
- The more fine details to make the game more fun could have been better. For example, character movement isn't very fluid. I didn't have time to add animations. 
- I wish I knew how important movement was to the feel of a platformer.
- I learned that movement is very important to the feel of a platformer.
