# KelvinLao-Projects
This is a repository where I store all the projects I have worked on so far.

### Face Recogniton:
This was a final project done in MATLAB from my Linear Algebra class. It is a simple program which differentiates basketball player faces.

### Platform Game:
This is a 2D platformer game made in Unity using C#. The player starts at the left of the screen and has to traverse to a platform at the very right of the map. 
The player can jump and climb ropes
