# KelvinLao-Projects
This is a repository where I store all the projects I have worked on so far.

### Face Recogniton:
This was a final project done in MATLAB from my Linear Algebra class. It is a simple program which differentiates basketball player faces.

### Platform Game:
This is a 2D platformer game made in Unity using C#. The player starts at the left of the screen and has to traverse to a platform at the very right of the map. 
The player can jump and climb ropes and has to avoid monsters to get to the end.

### Simple Classifier:
This is a python program which contains both a binary classifier that takes in 2D data which is lineraly seperable and a a classifier which takes in data which has a decision boundary that goes through the origin and classifies it.

### Simple Fixed Shooter:
This is a 2D Fixed Shooter game made in Unity using C#. The player spawns in the middle and monsters spawn to the left and right of the player. The player will lose if they touch any monster. To win the player must kill 30 of these monsters. My plan for this project is to revamp it into a sidescroller game with RPG elements and try to fix some of the animation bugs.

### 1D SHM Model:
This is a NetLogo model I helped make for a teacher during a summer institute. This is a physics model for a spring that can move in one direction. The user can change the mass, spring constant, and inital position and then observe how it oscillates.

### BlackJack:
This is a Blackjack game I made in Java during my high school senior year.

### CATWOT Mask:
This is an engineering project I worked with a team of four on. Our goal was to try to prototype a new mask which would be easy to make at home during the mask shortage at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Produtive Commuting:
This is an engineering project I worked with a team of three on in high school. Our goal was to create a way for commuters to work while on long public transit trips. We created a prototype of a lapdesk which also worked as a writing surface and storage device to allow commuters to work on public transit.

### Sucide Rates Data Analysis Project:
This was the final project for my Intro to the Data Science Pipeline class. I worked in a team of three to analysis suicide rates and try to predict the suicide rates given the other paramters in the dataset. In this project we worked with a [suicide rates dataset from kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016) I worked on the age and generation EDA, the Polynomial Regression machine learning, and the preprocessing of the data.

### Visual Deflector Watching Hands Play:
This is an engineering project I worked with a team of four on. We worked with the Shirley Ryan Abilitylab in downtown Chicago to create a product which would allow for people unable to move their heads to be see their hands and use them in activities such as drawing or playing with toy cars.
